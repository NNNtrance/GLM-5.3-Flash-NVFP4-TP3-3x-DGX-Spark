"""Per-category decode speed and speculative acceptance on a warm engine:
prose / code / math / structured-json. Concurrency 1 sequential, then
concurrency 4 in parallel, six prompts per category.

WHY THIS SCRIPT EXISTS: aggregate tok/s hides the fact that the DFlash2 drafter
behaves completely differently per workload. Code, math and JSON accept 44-60%
of drafted tokens and run 2-2.8x faster than no speculation at all; free prose
accepts about 13% and falls back to roughly the unspeculated rate.

NOTE ON COMPARABILITY: the category numbers we published were measured with the
ORIGINAL prompt set, in which half of the prompts in each category were in
Turkish and half in English. The prompts below are the English translations of
that set. Acceptance on the prose category in particular may differ slightly
from our published 13%; treat a rerun as your own baseline rather than as a
reproduction of ours.
