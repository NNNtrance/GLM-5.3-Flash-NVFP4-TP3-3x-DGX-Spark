"""Output-correctness probe: 10 short questions with machine-checkable answers,
plus one long paragraph checked for repetition locks.

A broken MoE path (experts multiplied by zero, a mis-shaped decode kernel)
produces repetition locks or fluent nonsense here; a healthy engine passes
10/10 clean. This is the cheapest gate we have -- run it after every engine
start and after every configuration change.

Usage: python3 correctness-probe.py [API_BASE]   default http://192.0.2.10:8000
Exit code 0 on a full pass, 1 otherwise.
Written by us for this recipe; use freely (Apache-2.0).

Two counts are reported on purpose. With thinking ON the model sometimes puts
the whole answer in the reasoning field and leaves content EMPTY -- same
prompt, same settings, even at temperature 0. So:
  content  : what a plain client sees
  both     : what the model actually knows"""
